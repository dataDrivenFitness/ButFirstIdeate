## What Is This?

The Vibe Coding Blueprint is a collection of guides, templates, and best practices for building apps with AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.). It addresses the real problems developers face:

- AI that over-engineers everything
- Destructive commands that delete your work
- Inconsistent code that doesn't match your patterns
- Hours wasted on hallucinated APIs
- Scope creep that turns simple tasks into nightmares

**This framework solves these problems** through strategic documentation, safety rails, and situational prompting techniques.
